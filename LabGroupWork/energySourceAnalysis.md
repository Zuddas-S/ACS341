# Comparison of Different Energy Sources
as part of our project we look to compare the different energy production techniques.

## Sustainable
### Hydro Storage
### Hydro River
### Wind Onshore
###



## Fossil Fuel Based
### Brown Coal
### Oil
### 

## Nuclear
Nuclear refers to the energy released by atomic nuclei through nuclear fusion, nuclear fission or radionuclear decay. Nuclear power plants obtain a large amount of energy by fission and release of nuclear fuel made of uranium in the reactorã€‚This energy is very clean, but there are risks associated with this clean energy. If nuclear energy leaks, radiation will be released, seriously affecting organisms and ecology within a few kilometers.

## Other
Energy can be obtained from other, other renewable and waste.

Renewable energy is mostly included in sustainable energy (refer to sustainable energy).

As a domestic product, waste can be incinerated to generate energy, but there are also drawbacks. A large amount of toxic gases will be produced without complete combustion and special handling.
