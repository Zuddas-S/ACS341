# Comparison of Different Energy Sources
as part of our project we look to compare the different energy production techniques.

## Sustainable
### Geothermal
Geothermal energy is the energy dissipated by the lava inside the earth through cracks in the earth. The energy generated by geothermal energy is considerable, but it will be required by the terrain, and it needs to be obtained in places with crustal faults.

### Hydro Storage

### Hydro River

### Wind Onshore and Offshore 
Wind Offshore and Wind Onshore are wind energy generated through temperature differences due to differences in solar exposure and heat absorption in different regions.This energy is also a very clean energy. It can be obtained all year round, but the energy obtained will also change due to the change of seasons, and the amount of wind energy obtained will also be affected by the location of the sea and land.


### Solar
Solar is the light and heat energy that comes from the sun. Solar energy is also a very clean energy source, but it is also affected by latitude. In low latitudes, it will get relatively sufficient sunlight due to its proximity to the direct sun point, but the irradiation intensity in high latitudes will not be very impressive.

## Fossil Fuel Based
### Brown Coal
### Oil

## Nuclear
Nuclear refers to the energy released by atomic nuclei through nuclear fusion, nuclear fission or radionuclear decay. Nuclear power plants obtain a large amount of energy by fission and release of nuclear fuel made of uranium in the reactorã€‚This energy is very clean, but there are risks associated with this clean energy. If nuclear energy leaks, radiation will be released, seriously affecting organisms and ecology within a few kilometers.

## Other
Energy can be obtained from other, other renewable and waste.

Renewable energy is mostly included in sustainable energy (refer to sustainable energy).

As a domestic product, waste can be incinerated to generate energy, but there are also drawbacks. A large amount of toxic gases will be produced without complete combustion and special handling.
