# Comparison of Different Energy Sources
as part of our project we look to compare the different energy production techniques.

## Sustainable
It is sustainable for Geothermal, Hydro Pumped Storage Arregated, Hydro pumped Storage Consumption, Hydro Run of river And Poundage, Hydrowater Reservoir, Marine, Solar, Wind Off shore and Wind On shore. They are natural energies from the sun, within and by the earth that can be continuously obtained and used.

Geothermal energy is the energy dissipated by the lava inside the earth through cracks in the earth.

Hydraulic pumped storage, hydraulic pumped storage consumption, hydraulic operation of rivers and reservoirs, reservoirs, oceans are energy obtained through the difference in gravitational potential energy created by the earth's gravity and geographic altitude.

Solar is the light and heat energy that comes from the sun.

Wind Off shore and Wind On shore are wind energy generated through temperature differences due to differences in solar exposure and heat absorption in different regions.

## Fossil Fuel Based
Biomass, Fossil Brown Coal lignite, Fossil Coal derived Gas, Fossil Gas, Fossil Hard Coal, Fossil Oil, Fossil Oil Shale, Fossil Peat are all fossil fuels and gaseous fuels from the energy contained in the organism, the direct extraction of the organism and the anaerobic digestion of a large number of phytoplankton and zooplankton organic residues in the seabed and lake bottoms for millions of years.

## Nuclear
Nuclear refers to the energy released by atomic nuclei through nuclear fusion, nuclear fission or radionuclear decay. Nuclear power plants obtain a large amount of energy by fission and release of nuclear fuel made of uranium in the reactorã€‚

## Other 
Energy can be obtained from other, other renewable and waste.

Renewable energy is mostly included in sustainable energy (refer to sustainable energy).

As a domestic product, waste can be incinerated to generate energy, but there are also drawbacks. A large amount of toxic gases will be produced without complete combustion and special treatment.
