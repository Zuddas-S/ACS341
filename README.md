# ACS341
ACS341 is a year three machine learning module, based on the book Hands on Machine Learning using Scikit Learn and Tensor Flow. 
The goal with this repository is to get to grips with working collaboratively using GitHub and reduce down the ideas taught in the book to help with comprehension.
